This project is being revived/rewritten for 1.15.2 - Enjoy!

Note:
* Please report 1.15.2 issues in THIS repository, NOT at pixlepix's, or baileyholl's.
* Do not ask for design changes, I am still evaluating what elements of the original mod will stay and which will be too tedious to implement.
* This fork, like the mod itself, is licensed under the [MIT license](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) and the parts drawn from Botania under the [Botania license](http://botaniamod.net/license.php).
